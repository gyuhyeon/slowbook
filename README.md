# slowbook
This was a little project I did for a couple of days for a friend to present at a business idea competition.  
It had a rudimentary node.js backend server, with a simple DB backend.  
It shows a PDF version of books through a link, which is fetched from the DB through the node.js server to the client.  
This was my first tutorial into node.js, so it might help anyone new to node.js or server architecture overall in understanding the concepts.  
  
# How to use
Assuming node.js is installed, in the project folder, do the following:  
```
npm install  
node app.js
```
